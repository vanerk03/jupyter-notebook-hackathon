# Research Hackathon base repository 

Hi everyone and welcome to our hackathon! 
To start participating, fork this repo.
For more information on schedule and policy, please refer to the [participation terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I8NiqFuqMY3yjABH9DHAN764GljOHyyy5cYQRRxTttQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Setting up the virtual environment

After forking, first of all, you need to set up the virtual environment, which includes _Jupyter Notebook_ and our logging plugin.

In order to set up a virtual environment:
- If you are using a terminal, firstly, create a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/): `virtualenv hackathon_env`, 
and then activate it: `source hackathon_env/bin/activate`.
- If you are using PyCharm, create a new Python project with the new environment using `Virtualenv`.

## Setting up the logging

Once, you have set up the environment, you can install the necessary packages.

To do this, you can simply use the provided bash script:
 - `bash setup_environment.sh`

**OR**

Run the following commands in the terminal:
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 - `jupyter nbextension install --py mining_extension --user`
 - `jupyter nbextension enable --py mining_extension --user`
 - `python3 -m jupyter notebook`

*Note: if you are using PyCharm, execute the bash script or commands above using the internal terminal*.
 

Then, in _Jupyter Notebook_, you need to find the _Nbextentions_ tab (green), and in this table you 
need to find _Logs mining extension_.

If you click on the _Logs mining extension_, below this list of the extensions, you will see a configuration panel for the mining extension.
You will need to check the box next to the item _"I agree to post my logs to the remote server"_
and to fill in the address with the one provided by the organizers.

## Working with tasks

The descriptions of tasks can be found in `task1.md` and `task2.md`. 
The data for the tasks can be found in `data/task1` and `data/task2`, respectively. 
The solution should be written in the _Jupyter Notebook_ configured as described above, in the provided files `task1.ipynb` and `task2.ipynb`. 

Before commencing the work, make sure that everything works correctly by running the following code:
```
from mining_extension import check_logging 
check_logging("PASTE URL HERE")
```

## Submissions

To submit your work, you need to make a two-minute presentation at the end of the hackathon and fill the form, 
providing the link to your repository fork. 
We will check only the main branch and will use `requirements.txt` to install all the necessary packages,
so don't forget to push and keep track of your dependencies.
